"""
Tests for B-014: ai_team.core.lock — project-local mutual exclusion for
concurrent artifact ID allocation.

Cycle 1 scope:
  - ``allocation_lock`` serializes two real threads racing for the same lock.
  - ``allocation_lock`` releases on normal exit and on exception.
  - ``allocation_lock`` raises ``LockTimeout`` after a bounded wait instead of
    hanging forever when another holder does not release in time.
  - ``create_artifact_with_lock`` prevents the diagnosed scan-then-write race:
    two concurrent callers of "scan for next id, then write" never observe
    the same "next id" once wrapped in the lock.

All coordination below uses ``threading.Event``/``threading.Barrier`` with a
bounded ``timeout=`` as a hang safety net only — never ``time.sleep`` to
control ordering between threads.
